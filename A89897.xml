            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>A PREFACE.</hi> To English Catholicks.</head>
            <p>LIGHTING accidentally upon the enſuing Treatiſe, I was ſo pleaſed with its ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, facility and brevity that I was moved to tranſlate it for your uſe and profit (eſpecially for ſuch as underſtand not french) whoſe preſent ſufferings muſt needs give you a ſight of the vanity and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of this world, and move you to ſeek a more ſecure, ſolid, and laſting happineſſ in the next, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the inſtructions you will here meet with, will eaſily and ſecurely lead you: For ſuch well diſpoſed perſons as you are, this Treatiſe was writ, and for ſuch alſo I tranſlated it: who having undergon the ſharp
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154306:7"/>
tryals of long and ſevere perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are trained up and fitted for a greater combat: where you are to become your own adverſaries, and are to engage with no other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies then your ſelves; which I call a greater combat, becauſe a greater courage and conſtancy is required thereunto: for one blow is ſufficient to crown a martyr, whereas a war with yourſelves is to endure as many years as you live: perhaps not ſo bloody and cruel as the other, but yet more irkſom and vexatious, where you may over-come but can never have truce or peace: ſo much harder is it to live a martyr, then to die one, and more crowns are due when you die oftner and onely live to add new crowns by dying daily. This is a combat common to all Chriſtians, to all ſtates and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whilſt the other has been the happy lot only of a few: this reaps a harveſt of merits in the toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and laborious field of vertue,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154306:7"/>
whilſt the other is a free gift and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour beſtowed ſomtimes on the greateſt ſinners. Happy therfore and thrice happy are you, who are both choſen out for followers of the croſſ and alſo continue to follow it by your own free will and election, not like thoſe faint hearts who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not this happineſſ, but turning their backs to glory, do comply ſo much with eaſe and terrene inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to ſhrink out of the liſts, and decline this hard and toilſome enterpriſe: but eouragiouſly tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that rough yet only ſecure path to happyneſſe by which the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father led his beloved ſonne. <hi>Oportebat Chriſtum pati &amp; ſic intrare in gloriam</hi> are by ſoe happy a neceſſity of ſuffering diſpoſed to ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſentiments as this treatis will help you to practis, which therfore I hope will be the more acceptable to you: who I am ſure are ſo far from ſhunning the difficulties you will meet with in the exerciſes here
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154306:8"/>
preſcribed, that you will rather take them for the firſt copies ſet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, and for eaſy draughts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineating only the firſt grounds and out lines of perfection: whereby you being daily improved &amp; allured to ſo happy and profitable an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, will generouſly offer at more and greater; &amp; for the preſent, make it your delight to read a ſpirituall book, to be ſomtimes retired, and to abſent and often withdraw your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves from worldly converſation, to converſe with God, &amp; become more preſent to him and your ſelves; to reſiſt corrupted nature, and follow Chriſt in the way of the croſſ and mortification, and hereby become and continue ſuch true pretenders to heaven, as I either take you or heartily wiſh you to be; and that I may be one of that happy number, and become joynt parraker of what we all pretend to, everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; I humbly beg the aſſiſtance of your good prayers.</p>

               <hi>THE PREFACE.</hi> Of the neceſſity of performing our actions well, in order to perfection.</head>
            <p>YOu will not find here either ſtudied diſcourſes or elevated conceits tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the interiour and hidden life, and the vertues which it forms in us; there are ſpirituall books enough which give it's maximes, teach it's ſecrets, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it's illuſions; here are only plaine reflections upon our ordinary actions teaching with what ſpirit they ought to be animated; however I dare affirme that theſe practices are no leſſ profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to good ſouls than all thoſe high and ſublime rules which are given them, of the ſeverall degrees of prayer, &amp; inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour abnegation; for we want not ſo much knowledge &amp; inſtruction as the execution and practice thereof; we are ſufficiently inſtructed in this age in all ſpirituall matters, but our miſery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that we content our ſelves with the bare knowledge out of books
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154306:9"/>
that treat of them, &amp;, it may be with ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>King thereof in converſation; and if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happens that we find ſome relish of theſe truths, or penetrate a little dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then ordinary into them; we look on our ſelves as already great proficients in ſpirit, &amp; reſt there without paſſing on to any practice thereof. Tis enough at preſent for a devout perſon to have by him the Treatiſe called the Interiour Chriſtian, &amp; now and then to read in it, to believe himſelf a very ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon much advanced in perfection. We ſee many ſouls much addicted to read the latter end of this book, where it treats of the moſt high &amp; ſublime degrees of prayer: but we ſee very few who exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves in the practice of the love of contempt, mortification, and ſuffering, whereof the Authour treats in the beginning. For my part, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that we have more need of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our hearts touched, then our minds enlightened, and that we ſtand more in need to be animated to practice what is good, then to have bare deſires of it. wherfore I thought it very profitable to inſtruct good and devout ſouls how to perform all their exteriour actions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154306:9"/>
with an interiour ſpirit, &amp; not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their own humour, cuſtome or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, but to render their actions (as I may ſay) full of god, and to animate them with the ſpirit of his grace. In effect all who know what belongs to true devotion &amp; chriſtian perfection, agree that it conſiſts in doing the will of god, and that in ſuch manner as he will have it done: and that this is the ſanctity to which god calls all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of what condition ſoever. Now it is in the ordinary actions, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in his ſtate performs, that the will of god is marked out to us, and therefore all our perfection conſiſts in doing them well. All perſons are not capable of high and elevated prayer, and if they be not called to it, they will not at the day of Judgement be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for it, wherefore 'tis not neceſſary to them to Know the ſeverall degrees of prayer, and all that is got by ſuch notions, is either vanity, if they flatter themſelves with a belief that they are carried by thoſe ſublime wayes: or elſe diſcouragement, if they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uncapable of them: but there are none of how mean a capacity ſoever
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154306:10"/>
they be, who are not able to perform their actions with an interiour ſpirit, and therefore 'tis not only profitable, but neceſſary to Know how to animate them with it: becauſe we shall be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and judged upon this point, and the firſt head of our examination will be, whether we have acted as chriſtians, and not as Pagans, or barely as men?</p>
            <p>I add that it is very hard to very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls to penetrate, or even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the great maximes of abnegation, of relinquishing all humane things, of interiour ſilence, of the paſſive ſtate, of the death to all that is ſenſible, of the loſſ &amp; conſummation of a ſoul in god. But there is no ſoul, how little ſoever it be enlightened by god, which may not eaſily learn to perform theſe ordinary actions with chriſtian ſentiments; and regulate the conduct of it's life according to the maximes of the Goſpel: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I here lay down an eaſy way, or method, whereby all devout &amp; chriſtian ſouls may arrive to an eminent degree of vertue, fulfill the perfection of their ſtate, pleaſe god in all things they do, act in all things according to the ſpirit of grace, and not according to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154306:10"/>
ſentiments of nature, gather together in a short time great treaſures of merits, fly not onely idleneſſ the ordinary fault of the world, but the unprofitable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their life, the common errour even of vertuous perſons, perform from morning to night the will of god, without ſtraying one moment from this way, become (as David was) perſons according to gods own heart, &amp; in fine render themſelves by an exact fidelity, very great Saints: and this by doing nothing elſe but their ordinary daily actions. For my part, when I conſider that god has annexed our perfection to the exact performance of our daily actions, that 'tis of theſe he will require an account at the day of judgement, that it is to animate us to perform theſe that he gives us his graces, and that when we have any one of them to do, all that he requires of us, is nothing but our fidelity in performing it; I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee ſo few apply themſelves to a holy and exact performance of them; and that they ſeek vertue and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in things which god requires not at their hands. Let us therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make a firm reſolution to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:154306:11"/>
do all our ordinary actions of the day well, and place our perfection in this practice; let us avoid all things in them which may be diſpleaſing to god, &amp; take care to omit nothing in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance which may be pleaſing to him; let us perform them after ſuch a manner, as that god may be the ſoul of all our actions and endeavours, and that there may be nothing human or unprofitable in all that we do, ſo that we may never be one moment without meriting and tending towards god; that Jeſus-Chriſt may live in us, as the Apoſtle ſays, and that the ſpirit of his grace may ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate all our thoughts, all our words, and all our works. I know very well that ſouls who are after an extraordinary manner carried to prayer, ought not to tie themſelves to particular motives or reflections for the right performance of their actions, and that they ought to content themſelves in following with fidelity the impulſe of gods grace, and to ſuffer themſelves to be led to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them by the ſpirit which animates them, and which will make them avoid the imperfections which are ordinarily committed in ſuch perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:154306:11"/>
even when they do not foreſee them: But ſince there are very few ſuch ſouls, and that they as well as others will be able to find in the advice that I give, the ſources of retirement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, that is to ſay, ſuch thoughts as will maKe them enter into themſelves even in the midſt of their diſtractive Imployments, there are therefore few perſons, or to ſay better, none, who may not reap profit out of theſe exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But that they may be able to do ſo, I would councell them to read them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, till ſuch time as having ſo fixed in their minds all theſe ſentiments, they may upon all occaſions uſe them as a rule whereby to perform all their actions in an holy manner, and it would be good alſo to run them ouer at the end of the weeK or month, thereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and taKe a view of all their faults. In the beginning they may alſo content themſelves with the practice of the rules relating to the performance of ſome particular action, as of Maſſe, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and afterwards endeavour to perfect themſelves in the reſt. For I cannot but affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we have not any means more ſure, eaſy, and efficacious, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:154306:12"/>
our ſelves Saints, &amp; arriving to an eminent degree of vertue, then by doing all our actions with an interiour ſpirit: this is that we ought to apply our ſelves to, all the days of our life, and we may aſſure our ſelves that to die in this exerciſe, is to die the death of Saints.</p>

to happen to you in prayer, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on this as the beſt way to profit much in a short time in the pure loue of god, which is ſo remote from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſenſible: Moreouer in this condition you ought to do nothing elſe ſave onely (1) to humble and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late your ſelf before the divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God, looKing on your ſelf as unworthy to ſpeaK unto him.

Beg of our Saviour to augment &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it in you, &amp; to render it lively &amp; active; deſire him to enlighten &amp; convert all Infidels &amp; Hereticks; &amp; offer your ſelf to his juſtice to ſuffer that day ſomething for their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

                  <p>OF all the actions of the day this is that in which you ought moſt to ſtand upon your guard, becauſe there is more danger of offending God in this then in all others. In effect the holy Scripture ſays, that he who offends not with his tongue is perfect: wherefore to render your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion truly Chriſtian, &amp; in it to bridle your tongue, obſerve the following advice. Firſt, never ſpeak of the faults of others, if you be not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in conſcience to reprehend them, or to give others account of them.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:154306:22"/>
Secondly before you enter into con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verſation, recommend your heart &amp; tongue to your good Angell, that yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> may ſay nothing, nor conſent to any thing that is ſaid againſt your neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour. Thirdly avoid as much as you can the converſation of worldings who ſpeak of nothing in theſe times but vanity, fashions, &amp; ornaments a la mode; But when neceſſity or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency obliges you to ſuch company, ſtay as litle amongſt them as may be, becauſe one ordinarily comes from them with wandring thoughts, &amp; a heart very inſenſible of what belongs to God. Fourthly take care alſo not to talk too much of devotion, of prayer &amp; direction, becauſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily there is much of ſelf-loue &amp; vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſpeaking too much of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; it is more ſecure to hear others then to ſpeak much on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Fifthly, Notwithſtanding you ought to let no converſation paſſ in which you do not handſomly bring in ſome good diſcourſe (&amp; you will do well to ſeek the company of ſuch as love to ſpeak of God) nevertheleſſ
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154306:22"/>
you ought to entertain none but your directour with any diſcourſe of your own interiour. Sixthly, never ſay any thing either to your own advantage, or againſt your ſelf, for oftentimes it is a counterfeit humility to undervalue ones ſelf before others; whereas we should be very ſorry that they should believe us to be ſuch as we repreſent our ſelves; but the true mark of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere humility is not to excuſe our ſelves when we are reprehended or blamed for any thing. That a wife may Keep the reſpect due to her husband, &amp; a child to its father &amp; mother, let them remember never to looſe it in ſpeaking, ſaying nothing that may offend them, nor contradicting them with obſtinacy, or anſwering them with coldneſſ, indifference, diſreſpect, or contempt. Eightly, if you deſire the ſpirit of recollection &amp; prayer, fly the world &amp; company as much as you can, never maKing viſits but for meer neceſſity, nor entertaining any familiar acquaintance but with one or two perſons of devotion like your ſelf.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. One ought to form a high Idea of this vertue, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a fervent deſire to practiſe it; &amp; for this reaſon, it were good to make a meditation of it, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the middle, &amp; in the end of the month.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One ought to receive it from ones Directour, as from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who inſpires him therewith, &amp; who will exact an account of it ar the day of Judgment: it is good to beg it often of God, by the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the holy Patron recommended to your choice &amp; particularly, in the morning, at noon &amp; at night, ſaying

for this end, a <hi>Pater</hi> &amp; <hi>Ave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The practice of the vertue of the month, ought to be in this manner: (1.) you muſt offer the firſt communion of the month, to obtain it. (2) in the morning when you riſe, make a firm reſolution to practiſe it that day; forecaſting to your ſelf, the occaſions you may have to exerciſe it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Before dinner, recollect your ſelf the ſpace of a <hi>Pater</hi> &amp; <hi>Ave,</hi> to conſider how you have practiſed it, &amp; to ſee whether that morning you have exerciſed any acts of it, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the contrary vice; &amp; if you find you have, ask pardon of God, &amp; purpoſe to be more faithfull the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing part of the day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In your examen at night, make the ſame review, &amp; compare with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, the faults you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after dinner, with thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the morning, noting the number upon a paper, or with knots upon a piece of thred, to ſee if your fidelity was greater after dinner, then in the morning.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take care every dal, eſpecially
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:154306:83"/>
in the morning to make there acts of the month, &amp; the ſame after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp; for exteriour acts, take care to keep a watch over your ſelf that you fall not upon occaſion into the vice contrary to it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If you happen to fail, impoſe upon your ſelf immediately, ſome mortification, (if occaſion permits) that may be contrary to the fault you committed: for example, if you have for your vertue, to ſay nothing out of humour or inclination, or the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of your tongue; after you have failed, hinder your ſelf from ſpeaking when you have never ſo much mind to it, if it be nothing but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable diſcourſe; or keep a greater ſilence then ordinary, by retiring your ſelf; &amp; the like you may do, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of other vertues.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Give an exact account to your Directour, of your care or negligence in the practice of the vertue of the month, &amp; be afraid that God should withdraw his particular grace, of which you have great need, if you neglect this particular care, becauſe God will

treat you as you do him.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Perſwade your ſelf, that all your ſpirituall advancement depends upon your practice of this vertue, which if you neglect, you will never profit in it. Remember alſo to offer ſome of your alms &amp; mortifications to our Lord, to obtain this vertue, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to him by the hands of your Directour.</p>

               <p>SInce tis a truth of which we have daily but too great an experience, (&amp; which yet for all that, we too eaſily forget) that we muſt dye, that a ſuddain death may perhaps ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe us unawares; as we ſee happens often to thoſe that think leaſt of it; or that the extreme pains of our ſickneſſ, may deprive us of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to make thoſe acts that are neceſſary for this laſt hour, the hour of all hours moſt important; the hour, after which, there remains no more hours; the hour that decides our Eternall happineſſ, or miſery; 'tis neceſſary every month, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves by the exerciſes of a death in imagination, to thoſe which we muſt really practiſe, when we come actually to dye. Watch &amp; prepare your ſelves, becauſe the ſon of man will come at the hour you think leaſt of,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:154306:85"/>
Says our Saviour, in the 13. of S. Mark's Goſpell; &amp; in the 12. of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes, we are warned, that where the tree falls there it lyes.</p>
               <p>As near as you can, either the day before, or upon the day you exerciſe this devotion, make your Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall confeſſion, which will not hinder you from making your ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to Jeſus Chriſt, either before, or after the ſacramentall one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to each ones devotion.</p>
               <p>After confeſſion, make a ſacramental communion, by way of Viaticum, as if it were your laſt; &amp; in caſe you actually communicate, endeavour to have by you, ſome meddal, (to which the Pope has applyed a plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence) to gain one.</p>
               <p>Upon the day of your devotion, if poſſible, hear maſſ, to unite your ſelf more particularly in this holy ſacrifice (which is a reall repreſentation of that upon the croſſ) to Jeſus Chriſt dying, offering him to the eternall father, together with all the ſacrifices which shall be offer'd to the end of the world, to obtain the grace of a happy death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:154306:86"/>It will be very profitable to make choice of the laſt day of every month, for this exerciſe; &amp; if one be not minded to make it altogether, one may begin the firſt point in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; the ſecond, at ſome other hour that day; or otherwiſe, perform it in two days; &amp; then, one should repeat over again, the acts of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of faith, of hope, &amp; of charity, conteined in the firſt point, obſerving to make your meditation that day, upon the ſubject of death, &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ones ſelf more particularly, in good works, in the practice of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; other vertues.</p>
               <p>You muſt alſo take notice, that thô there be many acts noted in this exerciſe, 'tis onely to facilitate the practice of them to thoſe who for want of being habituated in them' would otherwiſe find great difficulty to perform them; for the beſt, are thoſe that love produces in our heart,</p>
               <p>We have added at the end of this diſcourſe, the recommendation of the ſoul, in English, for thoſe who having the devotion (thereby in a holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:154306:86"/>
to anticipate their death) to joyn theſe to the foreſaid devotions, do not underſtand them in Latin; &amp; in this caſe, one ought to change the termes that concern another to ones ſelf; as, in ſtead of ſaying, pray for him or her, or receive this ſoul; ſay pray, for me, receive my ſoul, &amp; ſo in other places; reſerving the concluſion of this exerciſe till after your laſt prayer.</p>
               <p>Now the fruit which one ought to draw from hence, (as shall be noted in the following meditation), is the contempt of the world, a weaning ones ſelf from creatures, the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of ones ſelf &amp; the amendment of ones faults; which are the true means to obtain the grace, to die a deat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You may make the meditation in the morning, after your prayer, &amp; before you go out. The firſt part
